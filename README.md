# Modular exponentiation in VHDL

This will be a synthesizable and simulatable VHDL source for modular exponentiation calculation that can theoretically be used to compute RSA or DH in hardware. The cores are not optimized in any way nor are they side channel atatck proof.

For real life pplicable solutions please get in touch!
